Thank you for this PR!

Could you amend your commits' names to use the [guidelines](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/How+to+write+a+commit+message), so that it is taken into account by our changelog tool?

To do this, open a command line window and use `git commit --amend` for the commit's name. See [GitHub's help page](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/) for more information.

_Note: this **must** be done via the command line: you can't do this just by changing the title of the pull-request from the GitHub interface!_ :)

Thank you!
